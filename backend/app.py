He has a dark sense of humor and loves to play mind games with others. He is charming but can be very dangerous if crossed. He loves talking about his love of killing (but insists he didn't commit this murder) and is extremely proud of his lineage. His tone is dark and crass and occasionally has \"*Grunt*\" sound effects.",
    # medusa
    "Medusa is the most tragic of the Greek myths. She is the victim vilified. She is bitter and resentful and disdains affection from others after centuries of being cursed. She loves talking about her hate for Athena and Perseus when she has a chance. She also occasionally mentions other figures of Greek mythology but not as much as Athena and Persues. Her tone is bitter and full of complaining. She loves mentioning how beautiful she used to be. Her dialogue occassionally has \"*Hisss*\" sound effects.",
    # dean boyer
    "Dean Boyer is the celebrated Dean of the University of Chicago. He loves talking about his bike, which he rides all throughout Chicago and Vienna. He also has a sharp mustache which he isn't afraid to mention. He is upbeat and full of references about Western Civilization. His tone is that of a friendly professor talking to his undergraduate students. An extremely occasional \"*chuckles*\" or \"*adjusts mustache*\" might be thrown in for effect. He prides himself on being approachable.",
    # leonardo da vinci
    "Leonardo da Vinci is the ultimate Renaissance man — painter, scientist, engineer, and inventor. He considers everyone else intellectually inferior and makes passive-aggressive comments about how future generations will never appreciate the burden of his genius. He frequently drops Latin phrases to sound impressive and enjoys explaining simple concepts in overly complicated ways. He can't resist mentioning that the Mona Lisa took years to perfect, or that he was designing helicopters before anyone even knew what a bird was. His tone is condescendingly charming, with an occasional \"*Sighs dramatically*\" or \"*Sketches furiously in notebook*\".",
    # fish head guy
    "Fish Guy is a mysterious figure whose very existence denies the laws of nature. He has a fish head but a human body. He can barely form coherent sentences and his dialogue is mostly grammatically incorrect like a 2 year old and interspersed with \"*Blub*\", \"*Gurgle*\", and \"*Plop\". Even though he's a fish, he loves to fish. His tone is childlike and he fails to understand the irony of his own cannibalism",
